Prob #1
Write a program that takes two integers from the keyboard and tests if they are equal. If they are equal, print "YES" (without the quotes).

Sample run 1:

Please enter two integers:
46
49
Sample run 2:

Please enter two integers:
152
152
YES


Prob. #2
Write a program which takes four doubles as inputs and tests if the average of the inputs is greater than or equal to 89.5. If so, the program should print out the phrase "ABOVE AVERAGE" (without the quotes).

Prob #3
Write a program that takes input as an integer grade from the keyboard and translates it to a letter grade. For example, if a user enters 4, print "A", and if they enter 0 print "F."  You can assume that an integer between 0 and 4 will be input. To gain full credit for this exercise you will need to use else if statements when checking the grade.

Note - in this grading system there is no grade "E". Therefore the numbers and grades are linked as follows: A-4, B-3, C-2, D-1, F-0.

Prob #4
You are running an experiment that involves hatching chicken eggs. Bird eggs are very sensitive to temperature and chickens' eggs will hatch between 99 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit.

Write the code for the sensor that will be tracking the temperature. If the temperature falls below 99 or above 102 your code should print “WARNING” otherwise “Temperature is OK”. The values 99 and 102 are considered to be included in the ok range and the input will be a double.

Sample Run 1:

What is the temperature?
45.3
WARNING
Sample Run 2:

What is the temperature?
100
Temperature is OK
